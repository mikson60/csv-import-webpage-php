# csv-import-webpage-php

## What is this?
This is a webpage written in PHP. It allows the user to upload new .csv files in a certain format, display and edit the results.
The csv files are stored in a remote database and can be accessed later.

## I want to try this
The project is live in Heroku (NB! Since this project is using a free version of Heroku and a remote database, the performance 
is horrible, especially for the first requests): https://shielded-brook-52698.herokuapp.com/

A test file that can be uploaded can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=18SgP4AyHI1OoBWIPJf92j_Q9aK3cbQtv
